# slimjim

**slimjim** is a multi-purpose adapter board for RF-Engine form-factor Synapse Wireless SNAP mpdules like the RF100 and RF200.
It also supports both versions of a custom board I've dubbed the TC200. All pins are broken out to a set of standard 0.1" (2.54 mm) headers
for jumper cables, breadboarding, or soldering.

- Module orientation markers for both types of supported module

## Supported boards
The following boards should work in the **slimjim**:

- RF100/RF200/RF220 (or any other 24-pin through-hole SNAP module)
